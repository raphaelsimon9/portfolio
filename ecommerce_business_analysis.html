							<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
							<p>
								I conducted an end-to-end analysis of an ecommerce business generating $7M in revenue across 7,000 orders, examining sales 
								performance, customer behavior, product mix, and geographic distribution to surface actionable growth insights.
								<br><br>

								Key findings included a 99.9% purchase conversion rate, Q4 as the strongest revenue period, and top categories led by Audio, 
								Health, and Electronics. I found that revenue was heavily concentrated in Texas and California, with high-value SKUs driving 
								a significant share of sales.
								<br><br>

								Based on my analysis, I developed strategic recommendations around new customer acquisition, 
								geographic expansion, and concentration risk - shifting the focus from conversion optimization to sustainable growth levers.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h5>Business Performance</h5>
								• Generated $7M in revenue from 7,000 orders, supported by a strong ~$1K average order value. • Achieved a 99.9% purchase conversion rate, indicating minimal funnel friction and effective demand capture. • Customer base is fully penetrated: 999 of 1,000 customers have placed at least one order.
								<br>

								<h5>Growth Dynamics</h5>
								• Revenue growth is driven more by order value and product mix than by order volume. • Q4 is the strongest performance period, with December delivering the highest revenue and momentum (+14%). • Noticeable seasonal softness occurs in February and August, followed by rapid recovery.
								<br>

								<h5>Product & Category Mix</h5>
								• Revenue is led by Audio (17.0%), Health (15.9%), and Electronics (15.2%). • Sales are concentrated in a small number of high-performing SKUs, with the top product generating $250K alone. • Product mix remains healthy, with no major disconnect between order volume and revenue contribution.
								<br>

								<h5>Geographic Concentration</h5>
								• Revenue is highly concentrated in Texas ($1.62M) and California ($1.23M). • Several states remain underpenetrated, presenting expansion opportunities.
								<br>

								<h5>Strategic Implications</h5>
								• Future growth will require new customer acquisition, geographic expansion, or product portfolio diversification, rather than conversion improvements. 
								• Operational focus should prioritize Q4 readiness, particularly inventory, supplier capacity, and marketing investment. • High dependence on top SKUs and key states introduces concentration risk, warranting diversification initiatives.
